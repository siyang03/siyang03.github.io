                <p>My name is Siyang Wan (万思扬). I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year undergraduate student major in Physics, at
                    Nankai University.</p>

                <p>I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1056148"
                        target="_blank">Prof. Ning Chen (陈宁)</a> during my undergraduate years, and looking forward to
                    spend my PhD years in <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1072096" target="_blank">Prof.
                        Zhong-Zhi Xianyu (鲜于中之)</a>'s research team.</p>

                <p>I have theoretical knowledge in General Relativity and some basic understanding in Quantum Field
                    Theory. I gained numerical analysis skills with Python during my internship with <a
                        href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1270452" target="_blank">Prof. Raúl Briceño</a>, at UC
                    Berkeley in summer 2023.</p>

                <h2>Research Experience</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>In summer 2023, I joined <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1270452" target="_blank">Prof.
                            Raúl Briceño</a>'s research team at UC Berkeley, studying the role of three-body system in
                        quantum computations of scattering observables. My project was to study the relativistic 3-body
                        scattering amplitude in 1-dimension and to seek trimers under the φb threshold. Under Raúl's
                        guidance, I derived the integral equation of the scattering amplitude above the φb threshold,
                        and solved it using Python. I then read Raúl's previous paper on the relativistic 3-body
                        scattering amplitudes (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04394"
                            target="_blank">arXiv:2303.04394</a> [nucl-th]), learned the numerical methods introduced in
                        it, and applied them to my program. In the end, I extended the solution below the φb threshold
                        to study whether bound states exist, equivalently speaking, to seek for poles of the
                        relativistic 3-body scattering amplitude below the φb threshold. I analyzed the singularities
                        and branch cuts of the exchange propagator and the 2-body scattering amplitude on the momentum
                        complex plane, and found that a new bound state (trimer) irrelevant to the Efimov effect exists
                        in 1-dim., while the Efimov effect does not exist.</li>
