        <section>
            <p>My name is Siyang Wan (万思扬). I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year undergraduate student major in Physics, at Nankai University.</p>
            
            <p>I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1056148" target="_blank">Prof. Ning Chen (陈宁)</a> during my undergraduate years, and looking forward to spend my PhD years in <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1072096" target="_blank">Zhong-Zhi Xianyu (鲜于中之)</a>'s research team.</p>

            <p>I have theoretical knowledge in General Relativity and some basic understanding in Quantum Field Theory. I gained numerical analysis skills with Python during my internship with Prof. Raúl Briceño, at UC Berkeley in summer 2023.</p>

            <h2>Research Experience</h2>
    
            <ul>
                <li>In 2023 Summer, I participated Professor Raúl Briceño's (<a href="mailto: rbriceno@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">rbriceno@berkeley.edu</a>) research team at UC Berkeley, studying the role of three-body system in quantum computations of scattering observables. My project is to study the relativistic 3-body scattering amplitude in 1 dimension and to seek trimers under the φb threshold. Under Raúl's guidance, I derived the integral equation of the scattering amplitude above the φb threshold, and solved it by programming in Python. I then read Raúl's previous paper on the relativistic 3-body scattering amplitudes (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04394" target="_blank">arXiv:2303.04394</a> [nucl-th]), learned the numerical methods introduced in it, and applied them to my program. Finally, I extended the solution below the φb threshold to study whether bound states exist, equivalently speaking, to seek for poles of the relativistic 3-body scattering amplitude below the φb threshold. I carefully analyzed the singularities and branch cuts of the exchange propagator and the 2-body scattering amplitude on the momentum complex plane. I found that the Efimov effect does not exist in 1-dim, and found a new bound state (trimer) irrelevant to the Efimov effect.</li>
